# 4. Numpy - Data Science
Python Numpy is a powerful library that provides advanced numerical calculations and manipulation capabilities. It is a library of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python and is used extensively in data science and machine learning. It has tools for integration with other popular libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. It also has powerful linear algebra and random number capabilities. Many of the popular machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, depend on Numpy for their numerical computations. Numpy is highly efficient and is built to be used with large datasets. It is one of the most popular libraries used by data scientists and machine learning engineers.
